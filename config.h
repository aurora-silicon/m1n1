// Unified J414s Windows profile (branch feature/j414s-windows-unified; see

// and docs/windows-unified.md for the build and ownership contract).
//
// When this is defined (it requires ENABLE_VGIC_MODULE, enforced below), a guest
// booted under the hypervisor starts on the emulated GICv3 carrier, then drives
// the real Apple AIC after the Windows HAL extension enables AIC2 CONFIG:
//
//  - HCR_EL2.IMO and the GICD/GICR hooks remain active during firmware and early
//    Windows startup. This is required by the inbox GIC callbacks that execute
//    before the Apple HAL's deferred carrier replacement.
//  - hv_aic.c forwards the real AIC register page and watches AIC2 CONFIG. On its
//    enable write, each CPU clears its virtual-interface state and HCR_EL2.IMO;
//    physical AIC IRQs then reach the guest at EL1 with zero EL2 involvement.
//  - The physical timer FIQ is reflected to the guest as an ordinary per-CPU AIC
//    software-generated IRQ after handoff; before handoff it uses the original
//    GIC list-register carrier path. HCR_EL2.FMO remains set throughout.

// J414s Windows MTP/DockChannel preboot handoff.
//
// The MTP coprocessor must already be running when the Windows AppleMtpHid
// ACPI driver takes ownership of the DockChannel transport.  The handoff
// helper is deliberately compiled only with the native-AIC Windows profile
// and has a second, exact runtime J414s identity check, so normal
// m1n1/macOS/Linux boots
// never touch MTP, its DART, or its DockChannel FIFOs.

// Leave every non-proxy J414s Type-C policy controller in a Source/DFP
// configuration before Windows takes ownership of its xHCI controller.  This

// signal alone does not make the external Type-C controller source VBUS.
#define ENABLE_J414S_WINDOWS_USB_HOST_HANDOFF

// Opt-in proxy operation that installs the persistent J414s BCM4388 SID-1
// deny-all domain after pcie_init() and before hv_start(). It additionally
// requires an explicit top-of-memory reservation paired with Mu's DRT0
// profile; compiling this capability never reserves or mutates wireless state.
#define ENABLE_J414S_WINDOWS_WIRELESS_HANDOFF

// Opt-in proxy operation for the J414s media profile (MCA/ADMAC audio, AOP PDM
// microphones, ISP camera).  Like the wireless handoff above, compiling this
// capability neither reads nor mutates any media device: media_handoff.c has no
// automatic call site anywhere in m1n1, so a boot that never issues the
// explicit P_MEDIA_HANDOFF_INIT proxy request behaves exactly as it does
// today.  The operation itself defaults to a read-only census; each hardware
// write it can perform needs its own flag bit on top.
#define ENABLE_J414S_WINDOWS_MEDIA_HANDOFF

// Opt-in proxy operation that generates the AGX preboot initdata triple
// (HwDataA/HwDataB/Globals) into an explicit top-of-memory reservation, so the
// Windows AppleAgxGpu KMD is handed real calibration blobs instead of Mu's
// zero-filled placeholders.  Like the handoffs above, compiling this capability
// touches nothing: gpu_handoff.c has no automatic call site, so a boot that
// never issues P_GPU_INITDATA_FILL behaves exactly as it does today.  The
// operation only READS the GPU (its ADT power tables and two ID registers) and
// only WRITES DRAM; it never powers the GPU down.
#define ENABLE_J414S_WINDOWS_GPU_INITDATA_HANDOFF

// Diagnostic only; not part of any boot path's behaviour.
//
// Firmware is the only thing on this platform that writes to the serial
// console, so the console goes quiet the instant an EFI application takes
// over -- and a healthy application is indistinguishable from a wedged one
// from outside.  That blind spot starts exactly where the Windows boot
// manager starts.
//
// The EL2 host tick keeps running whatever the guest does, so sample the
// guest's own PC from it and print a low-rate heartbeat.  Read-only: it
// touches no guest state and changes no control register, so a boot with
// this enabled follows the same path as one without, just noisier.
//
// Leave this off for measurement runs; the printing itself costs guest time.
