/*
 * Turn the AIC on the first time the guest asks for a device interrupt.
 *
 * The controller is off at this point: iBoot hands over with it clear and Mu's
 * ExitBootServices callback clears it again, so a line can be unmasked and
 * asserted -- both observable in MASK_SET and HW_STATE -- and still reach no
 * CPU at all.  That was the state J813's keyboard sat in with its driver
 * started and its FIFO full.
 *
 * A GICD_ISENABLER write for an SPI is the right trigger: it is the guest
 * saying it wants a specific device line delivered, which on this machine is
 * also the moment m1n1 becomes responsible for delivering it.  Doing it here
 * rather than at hv_start() keeps the controller off for the whole of Mu, which
 * owns its own interrupts and must not have them redirected to EL2.
 *
 * SGIs and PPIs deliberately do not arm it.  They are not AIC lines.

/**
 * General idea of how this should work:
 * 
 * Apple Silicon chips since the M1 implement the GIC CPU interface registers in hardware, meaning
 * only the distributor, the core specific redistributors, and (potentially) an ITS need to be emulated by m1n1.
 * 
 * As such, this file implements most of the code needed to make this possible. The emulated distributor/redistributors
 * will need to meet a few constraints (namely it's limited by what the GIC CPU interface supports)
 * 
 * Apple's vGIC CPU interface has the following characteristics (on M1 and M2):
 * - 32 levels of virtual priority and preemption priority (5 preemption/priority bits)
 * - 16 bits of virtual interrupt ID bits (meaning up to 65535 interrupts are supported theoretically, however practically limited by the number of IRQs the AIC supports)
 * - supports guest-generated SEIs upon writing to GIC registers in a bad way 
 *   (note that an errata here exists on pre-M3 SoCs that can result in a host SError - we implement special handling for this.)
 * - 3 level affinity (aff2/aff1/aff0 valid, aff3 invalid/reserved as 0)
 * - legacy operation is not supported (ICC_SRE_EL2.SRE is reserved, set to 1) (no GICv2 operations)
 * - TDIR bit is supported (FEAT_GICv3_TDIR)
 * - extended SPI and PPI ranges are *not* supported on M1/M2 (and their Pro counterparts, even if the SoC itself has > 16 cores)
 * - 8 list registers
 * - direct injection of virtual interrupts are not supported (not a GICv4, and by extension, no NMIs supported)
 * - IRQ/FIQ bypass are not supported
 * 
 * 
 * The mappings are different for platforms with 36-bit vs 42-bit physical addressing, with 36-bit platforms tentatively
 * having the distributor being mapped to 0xF00000000, redistributors at offset +0x10000000
 * and 42-bit platforms having the distributor at 0x5000000000, redistributors at offset +0x100000000
 * 
 * A major note about processor affinities: since AICv2 platforms don't support setting core affinities easily,
 * the tentative solution is to do routing to any virtual CPU once we receive an IRQ, we can't assume
 * that the core that got the IRQ is the one that needs to be signaled. (for FIQs, because they're core specific,
 * we'll know which core needs to be signaled in those cases.)
 *
 * windows-native-aic (branch windows-native-aic, config.h: ENABLE_NATIVE_AIC_PASSTHROUGH):
 * when that flag is on, the GICD/GICR/ITS hooks remain the firmware and early-Windows
 * startup carrier. hv_aic.c observes the real AIC2 CONFIG enable write after the HAL
 * extension replaces the carrier callbacks; each CPU then disables its virtual CPU
 * interface and clears HCR_EL2.IMO before native AIC delivery begins.
