 * Emulated TPM 2.0 CRB (Command Response Buffer) device.
 *
 * J414s has no TPM. Windows will not accept a TIS/FIFO device on ARM64 --
 * tpm.sys only works with CRB (TCG start method 7) -- so this synthesises a
 * CRB register file over one 4 KiB locality page and lets Project Mu publish
 * an ACPI TPM2 table and an MSFT0101 device pointing at it.
 *
 * EL2 is the only layer that can host this: UEFI DXE code stops running at
 * ExitBootServices, so a Mu-only implementation would leave Windows' MMIO
 * accesses landing on nothing.
 *
 * The register layout, the INTF_ID probe value and the ACPI table encoding are
 * stated once, host-tested, in the companion driver repository at
 * drivers/AppleTpmCrb/AppleTpmCrbCore.{h,c}. Its tests assert that the address
 * published in the TPM2 table equals the address this code decodes CTRL_REQ
 * at. Do not change one side without the other.
