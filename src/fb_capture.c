 * Not a checksum for integrity -- a change detector. What matters is that a
 * single flipped pixel changes the value (FNV-1a avalanches well enough for
 * that) and that it costs one multiply per word, because this runs at EL2 in
 * the middle of the guest's exits. A 64x64 tile is 4096 words; at that size the
 * loop is memory-bound, which is the point: the pixels are already being
 * touched by the converter.
 *
 * Collisions mean a missed update, not corruption: the tile simply is not
 * re-sent until it changes again. At 2^32 that is not a risk worth a wider

 * pinning the identical Mu/WinPE boot against the m1n1 immediately before this
 * file existed,
 *
 *   with the HV call sites:    2 of 3 boots died on a guest SError (EC=0x2f,

 * the access pattern rather than the rate: hashing tiles pulls the framebuffer
 * through the MAIR_IDX_NORMAL_NC mapping from inside the guest's own exit
 * paths.
 *
 * Host-driven costs nothing, because the host is already paying. A capture
 * with a guest running happens inside an `hv eval`, which stops the guest for
 * 0.4-1.0 s whatever it does; one extra proxy request to advance the detector
 * disappears into that. And with no guest there is nothing to disturb at all.
 *
 * The rule this encodes: a debug facility may cost the host whatever it likes,
 * but it must not sit on the guest's execution path.
