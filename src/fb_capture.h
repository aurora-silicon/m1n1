/*
 * fb_capture: let the host see the screen without stopping the guest.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES IS NOT BANDWIDTH, IT IS THE VM EXIT.
 *
 * A host-initiated read of the framebuffer traps out of the guest and holds it
 * there for the whole transfer. Measured on J813 2026-08-12: the proxy moves
 * ~6 MiB/s, and one 2560x1664 frame is 16.25 MiB, so a full-frame screenshot
 * stopped the guest for ~2.9 s. Windows sees that as a time jump, and multi-
 * second stalls are DPC/clock-watchdog bugcheck territory (0x133, 0x101). A
 * screenshot tool must not be able to wedge the thing it is looking at.
 *
 * So the host must be told WHAT CHANGED before it reads anything. This file
 * maintains, at EL2, a per-tile hash of the framebuffer plus a dirty bitmap.
 * The host reads the descriptor (a few KiB), and then only the tiles whose
 * hash moved:
 *
 *   static screen   -> a few KiB instead of 16.25 MiB
 *   moving cursor   -> ~4 tiles, ~64 KiB, ~10 ms of stall, which is ordinary
 *                      DPC latency rather than a watchdog event
 *
 * THE SCAN IS HOST-DRIVEN. It does NOT run from the HV's exit paths -- doing
 * that killed guests with SErrors (see fb_capture_scan_now() in fb_capture.c
 * for the A/B that established it). The host advances it with
 * P_FB_CAPTURE_SCAN as part of the same call it was already making to read
 * the descriptor, so nothing here executes while the guest runs.
 *
 * TWO SURFACES, DELIBERATELY.
 *
 *   scanout - what the display controller DMAs to the panel. Allocated by
 *             iBoot, reused by m1n1, and written by everything afterwards, so
 *             it is valid with or without a guest: m1n1's own console, Mu, and
 *             (via hv_fb_convert_slice) the guest. This is the one to read
 *             when there is no guest at all.
 *   shadow  - the guest's BGRA buffer, present only while a guest runs.
 *
 * They are not interchangeable. The converter is rate-adaptive -- measured at
 * 51552 lines/s under load but 64 lines/s when the guest is idle, i.e. ~26 s
 * for a full 1664-line refresh -- so the scanout can lag the shadow badly.
 * The scanout is the truth about the PANEL; the shadow is the truth about what
 * the GUEST has drawn. The host picks, so both are described here.
