"""Host side of the emulated TPM 2.0 CRB: one proxy event per command.

The EL2 device (src/hv_tpm.c) validates each guest command's wire header,
then raises one HV_TPM proxy event carrying hv_tpm_exc_info. This module
reads the command out of the CRB data buffer, runs it through a real TPM
2.0 engine on the Mac, writes the response back, and declares the outcome
in the info struct. If anything goes wrong the event is answered with a
nonzero status and the guest sees a well-formed TPM_RC_FAILURE -- a TPM
that failed, never a TPM that lied or a guest that hangs.

The engine transports and the NV store live in the AuroraSilicon repo
(drivers/AppleTpmCrb/host/tpm_host.py, host-tested there, golden-vector
cross-checked against the C core). This module only carries bytes; it
deliberately contains no TPM knowledge beyond the info struct layout.

Set AURORADBG_DRIVERS to override the sibling AuroraSilicon repo location.
